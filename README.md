# handy-macOS-apps
Welcome to this repo!
Here I make .app files for macOS that are essentially shortcuts for changing settings on your Mac computer. You can run them to save time rather than hunting around in the settings app

The apps are essentially a few lines of applescript. I do not know how to code malware so yeah they should be fine. 
The apps are mainly tested on macOS 11 but should be compatible with newer macOS and older OSX versions. 

# Installation instructions
Warning: These apps are only compatible with macOS. I have no clue what they would do on windows or linux (I use Ubuntu btw)

1. Download the file. It should appear in your downloads folder as [app name].app.zip
2. Unzip the file. It should then appear as [app name].app
3. To install the app, open your applications folder *in finder* and drag the .app file to your applications folder. This step should be taken so that they show up in Launchpad.

Head to Launchpad and open the app as normal. You may need to allow some permissions, but these are nessecary for the app to work so it is reccomended that you allow them.

You can now use the app. If you would like to uninstall the app then just drag it from the applications folder to the bin.

# Enjoy!
