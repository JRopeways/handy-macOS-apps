# handy-macOS-apps
Welcome to the repo!
Here I make .app files for macOS that are essentially shortcuts in changing certain settings on your Mac computer. You can run them to save time rather than looking for the options in settings

The apps are essentially a few lines of applescript. I do not know how to code malware so yeah. 
The apps are mainly tested on macOS 11 but should be compatible with newer macOS versions. 

# Installation instructions
Warning: These apps are only compatible with macOS. I have no clue what they would do on windows or linux (I use Ubuntu btw)

1. Download the file. It should appear in your downloads folder as [app name].app
2. To install the app, open your applications folder *in finder* and drag the .app file to your applications folder. This step should be taken so that they show up in Launchpad.

Head to Launchpad and open the app as normal. You may need to allow some permissions, but these are nessecary for the app to work so it is reccomended that you allow them.
